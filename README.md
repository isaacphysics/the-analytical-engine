# the-analytical-engine

A fork of [`isaac-react-app`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-react-app), this repo was created to separate initial development of Ada Computer Science from the Isaac Computer Science handover process. The changes were merged back into `isaac-react-app` in [v3.0.0](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-react-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

Ada works on the-analytical-engine.
